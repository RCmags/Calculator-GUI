# Calculator-GUI
This is a simple calculator GUI made with tkinter. The calculator can perform basic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Beyond that it can delete the last input character (DEL) and it can clear the stored input (CE). It effectively mimmicks a cheap hand-held calculator.  

To use the calculator, simply execute "simple_calc.py" with the python shell. 

NOTE: This was written in python 3.
